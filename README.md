## Summary of App
Create your own golfing leagues and compete against your friends and social groups. Establish points for custom criteria and accomplishments achieved during each round played. Battle your opponents to try and earn the most points during a season (for fellow golfers, think Fed-Ex Cup<sup>&#174;</sup> points on the PGA Tour<sup>&#174;</sup>) while incentivizing yourself to continuously improve your game!

## Enchancements/updates/fixes I'd like to make in the future
- Add user authentication
- Add more styling and images
- Allow user to make updates to players and point settings
- Allow user to enter and track points earned under each point type
- Allow decimals to be entered into point weights
- Allow user to send emails to other players to invite them to league
- Refactor the app to use redux or at the very least create more simplified components and lift a lot of the state up
- Move some functions (e.g. sorting, ajax calls, etc.) into a stand-alone utilities file instead of polluting the components
- Fix round points input so that saving a player's total only saves the input corresponding to that player instead of the last input edited
- Add more client-side tests
