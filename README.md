### TODO: Link to live app: 

## Summary of App
This app allows you to create points-based golfing leagues for you and your friends and social groups. You can establish points for custom criteria and accomplishments achieved during each round played. The goal is to earn the most points during a season (for fellow golfers, think Fed-Ex Cup points on the PGA Tour) and have more incentive to continuously improve your game.
